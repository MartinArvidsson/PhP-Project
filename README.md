#Vision

My initial thoughts is to create a web based version of Tic-Tac-Toe(Luffarshack),I have yet to decide if i want it to be playable over the internet(share a URL beween 2 persons and they share the same game session)

Or if i just want to host it online and you will play it locally(Take turns playing 1,2,1,2,1,2....)

I plan on being done with the gamelogic at the end of this week(42), this leaves me with around one week to figure out if i want to play it over internet. 
The biggest problem with this is that i have more or less no idea of how to play it over internet with a shared URL.
This will therefore be work in progress that i will look at when all other things work.
