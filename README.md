#Vision

My initial thoughts is to create a web based version of Tic-Tac-Toe(Luffarshack),I have yet to decide if i want it to be playable over the internet(share a URL beween 2 persons and they share the same game session)

Or if i just want to host it online and you will play it locally(Take turns playing 1,2,1,2,1,2....)

I plan on being done with the gamelogic at the end of this week(42), this leaves me with around one week to figure out if i want to play it over internet. 
The biggest problem with this is that i have more or less no idea of how to play it over internet with a shared URL.
This will therefore be work in progress that i will look at when all other things work.

#How it ended up / Reflection:

The entire application took a lot longer to write than what i had anticipated and accounted for, writing the game and following the MVC structure took a lot more thinking and deciding on how i would write it.

When i got up and running and started programming i realised that i needed a lot of sessions since more or less everything i do caused variables to reset.. I realise in hindsight that i could have structured how i would handle the data a lot better now that i look back.

My schedule wasn't really matching with reality, i planned on working with gamelogic one week and making the game work online the second week. In reality i sat with the gamelogic for 10 days, i did not have time to peform online games as i had wanted , nor did i had any time to implement AI instead. So instead i made only two gamemodes, First to 3 and First to 5 wins.


I also felt that my usecases weren't really where i wanted to have them in quality and quantity, so in hindsight i added a few more.


Other than that i feel like i somewhat made what i had planned, it's a tic-tac-toe game and you can play it locally.
If i had had more time over, i would have done some CSS aswell, at the moment the website doesn't really look that good.
